# Geekangels

Geekangels connects people with questions about technology, computers and electronic devices with experts in the field. Clients can be helped by calling a local phone number, or by starting a hangout, skype call or chat session on this web site. Geek Angels will only charge when helping.

What kind of questions and problems?
Geek Angels have very diverse profiles. Some know all about internet, some know a lot about creating web sites, others are just tech savvy people who can help clients get the most out of their brand new iPhone.

Geekangels was launched as a proof of concept in 2010. But the concept still had 2 main problems: currency and trusthwortiness. 

With Ethereum and her smart contracts, we now have a way to decentralise and democratise our organisation, and install a viable business and trust model.

Today (feb 21, 2016) we start this new repo in order to create the tools needed for a succesful network of Geekangels.
